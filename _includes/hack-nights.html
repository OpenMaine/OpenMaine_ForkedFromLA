        <p>We host monthly Hack Nights in downtown Portland, usually on the third Thursday of the month. At these events, we organize groups of
            volunteers to build technology addressing Maine's biggest civic issues. Each night offers an
            inclusive, diverse community, and everyone is welcome. Join an existing project team or pitch your own civic
            issue.</p>
